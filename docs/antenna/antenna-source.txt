Hello :)

I am going to set up a radio telescope at the end of the year, and I am looking into suppliers right now.

I have a few questions:

1) Is 7m the largest dish you supply ?

2) What is the price of the largest dish ?

3) What is the cost for shipping to USA (San Jose, California) ? 

4) What are the import duties like ?

5) Are there any other costs apart from price/shipping/import ?

6) Can you ship to an address ? Or just to a port ?

7) Is it possible to get an Altitude/Azimuth positioner motor, rather than just a polar one ? 

8) Does the price include the motor positioner ? 

9) Does it come with a stand that can be bolted down ? If not, what does the system need in terms of support ?

10) What is the time-delay between order-taken and product-shipped ? 

11) Is it possible to get the largest dish in black rather than silver ?

12) Does it come with the feed-horn supports ?

13) What is the F/d for the largest dish ? Still 0.4 ? 

14) What is the spacing on the mesh (4mm, 6mm, ?mm)

15) Do you have a feed-horn for 1.42GHz ? 

16) Do the petals come with the mesh already applied to them, or is the mesh separate ?

Ok, more than a few questions - but hopefully that shows you I'm interested :)

If the price is good enough, and if I can get a rotor that works in 2 dimensions (eg: altitude/azimuth),  I may want to order more at a later point, to make an interferometer. I will start with one to see how well it works.


Thank you :)
