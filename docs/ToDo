    - Make the Waterfall work
    - Add command interface to GUI so it can control the daemon
	- Check that we really tuned to the frequency we asked for
	- make graphing auto-scaled, cache graph data
	

Calibration:
	
	- add gain, fft-size, window to calibration data
	- need to add name/device to config normalisation
	- allow filtering of RFI (needs storage & mgmt)

	

Need some way to calibrate the noise level of the system too. Thinking a
mode to be put in from the GUI - so the process becomes:

    - User runs GUI
    - place 50R connector at antenna end
    - Selects config options/toolbar/whatever
    - Send message to daemon that it should start sampling to calibrate
    - set a timer going on the UI (6 mins)
    - average and create noise floor to subtract from all incoming readings
    - get out of calibrate mode
